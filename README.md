#DESCRIPTION
The **Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor** is a powerful web-based application developed using a modern tech stack that includes **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and front-end technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The core objective of this project is to allow multiple users to collaborate on the same document simultaneously, with changes reflected in real time across all connected clients. This system is ideal for remote teams, content creators, and students who want to co-edit documents without the need for file sharing back and forth. At its backend, Node.js and Express.js are used to build a robust RESTful API and manage user sessions. Authentication is handled using session-based login, allowing secure access to document editing features. User credentials are stored securely in MongoDB, and session persistence is achieved via `connect-mongo`, ensuring logged-in users maintain access even across browser refreshes. The system includes key functionalities like user **signup**, **login**, and **logout**, along with **session tracking** to verify active users. Users can create documents with unique IDs, edit them in a browser-based text editor, and changes are saved instantly to MongoDB. Using **Socket.IO**, the platform enables real-time communication between connected users on the same document, which means when one user types or updates content, others see the changes live without needing to refresh. The frontend is built entirely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, offering a responsive and clean user interface. A simple, colorful layout allows users to toggle between login and signup views, and once authenticated, they are taken to the document editor interface where they can enter a document ID to load or create a document. The application provides buttons to **load**, **edit**, and **save** documents, along with an **auto-update mechanism** for collaborative editing. A navigation bar allows users to quickly access authentication or document functions. The real-time aspect of the editor makes it similar to collaborative tools like Google Docs, though it is much lighter and educational in nature, ideal for learning purposes. MongoDB serves as the primary database to store both user accounts and document content. This NoSQL database is chosen for its flexibility in handling dynamic data structures and easy integration with Mongoose ORM in Node.js. The systemâ€™s architecture is cleanly organized into models, controllers, and routes, making it easy to expand features in the future, such as adding role-based permissions, version history, or rich-text editing. In conclusion, the Real-Time Document Editor not only showcases how full-stack web applications work, but also highlights how real-time communication, authentication, and data persistence can be combined to create a seamless collaborative experience. This project is an excellent demonstration of integrating backend services with frontend interfaces while enabling real-time interaction using Socket.IO. It also gives practical experience in handling CORS, session cookies, form validations, and dynamic user interfaces with pure JavaScript, making it a valuable learning project for students and developers aiming to strengthen their full-stack development skills.
